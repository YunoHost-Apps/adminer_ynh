Replace phpMyAdmin with Adminer and you will get a tidier user interface, better support for MySQL features, higher performance and more security. See detailed comparison https://www.adminer.org/en/phpmyadmin/.
Adminer development priorities are: 1. Security, 2. User experience, 3. Performance, 4. Feature set, 5. Size.

Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin better alternate to phpmyadmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP.

You need to know the root password from here /etc/yunohost/mysql or the app username and password from setting.yml under /etc/yunohost/apps/appname to login.
For themes download the adminer.css from the main website and put the file in the app folder.
